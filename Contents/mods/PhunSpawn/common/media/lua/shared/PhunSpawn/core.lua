-- PhunSpawn
--
-- Spawn points that are earned rather than listed. A character starts knowing
-- the few the save is configured to give them and finds the rest by walking
-- the map or by building one, and a new character wakes up in a room rather
-- than on a kerb.
--
-- Standard Phun conventions, mirroring PhunInteriors and PhunCure2:
--   * everything hangs off this one global and nothing else,
--   * nothing may be hung off it under a name this table already declares,
--   * *_commands.lua returns a Commands table and *_events.lua dispatches
--     into it,
--   * server files open with `if isClient() then return end`, client files
--     with `if isServer() then return end`, and in SP both load,
--   * one code path for SP and MP, through Core.dispatch / Core.respond.
