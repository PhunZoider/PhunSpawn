-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The PhunInteriors hook: a spawn ROOM.
--
-- A soft hook and never a dependency. mod.info carries no require line, every
-- call in here is guarded, and with PhunInteriors absent the mod is a spawn
-- point picker that puts you on the square. That is a real fallback rather
-- than a broken feature, which is the only kind of optional integration worth
-- having.
--
-- Why a room at all: a character who wakes up on a kerb wakes up in whatever
-- is standing on it. A room is off grid, so the first thirty seconds of a new
-- character are theirs.
--
-- Registering on Events.OnInitGlobalModData rather than on one of
-- PhunInteriors' own events, and that is the rule to copy rather than the
-- exception. `Events` is a plain Kahlua table with no metatable, so a key
-- exists only once LuaEventManager.AddEvent has been called for it. If this
-- file loads before PhunInteriors' core.lua, `Events[theirs]` is nil and the
-- .Add throws. OnInitGlobalModData always exists, fires everywhere including
-- on a dedicated server, and by the time it fires all lua has loaded, so the
-- nil check below is decisive rather than a race.
--
-- It must NOT be OnGameStart: that is triggered only from
-- zombie.gameStates.IngameState, which a dedicated server does not have, so a
-- room registered there would exist on every client and on no server.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Our own room ids, namespaced. Nothing parses one; they are keys.
Core.roomIds = {
    -- The room a new character wakes up in. One design, stamped wherever the
    -- map author put it.

--- Is PhunInteriors present and far enough through booting to talk to?
function Core.interiorsReady()
    return PhunInteriors ~= nil and PhunInteriors.registerRoom ~= nil
end

--- Register the arrival room with PhunInteriors.
--
-- Deliberately registers the ROOM and no binding. A binding says which
-- vehicles or objects may lease a room, and nothing leases this one: a spawn
-- room is entered by being a new character, which is a different question
-- from the entitlement machinery and must not be squeezed into it.
--
-- TODO: this ships no `locations`, because there is no map yet. A room with
-- no stamps registers and allocates nothing, which is the honest state of
-- affairs. Fill it from the map once the cells exist, reading the origins out
-- of the lotpacks with PhunInteriors' Docs/tiles.pl rather than off a grid.
